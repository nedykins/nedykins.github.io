									<h1>Why Social Mobility <br />
										Could be Amazing for Your Health</h1>
									<p>The stress of overcoming prejudice and beating the odds appears to slow the ageing process, scientists have found...</p>

								<p>Social mobility might be a key policy of most politicians, which is good because recent studies have shown that social mobility might actually be good for your health, as multiple studies have suggested. 
									It has been shown that climbing the social ladder can bring wealth, prosperity and a better standard of living, and in fact, the excitement and hope of striving for success appears to have positive effects on the body. 
										It seems that overcoming prejudice and beating the odds actually slows down the damaging of DNA. </p>
								
								<p>A five-year study of disadvantaged teenagers in America found that those who had enough self-discipline to knuckle-down and work hard had the lowest levels of ‘DNA methylation’ – the process which switches off genes and leads to cell death. 
									Researchers at Northwestern University concluded that youngsters from low-income families who succeed academically and socially are probably healthier than those who are not aiming as high. 
										"We find that the psychologically successful adolescents, those with high self-control, have cells that are biologically newer, relative to their chronological age," said lead author Gregory Miller, professor of psychology in Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. 
											"In other words, there seems to be an underlying biological benefit to the self-control and the success it enables. This is most evident in the youth from the lowest-income families." </p>
								
								<p>Many previous studies have shown that children from low-income families do less well than their affluent peers, but they didn’t measure those climbed socially. The studies only viewed a small portion of low-income families and found that the children generally leave education earlier, have worse physical and mental health and are more likely to become substance abusers and commit crime due to their environment, but what about those that surpass their environment?
									As is politicians are keen to encourage social mobility believing that it would drive down crime rates and relieve the burden on the NHS. </p>

								<p>President Obama has frequently stated that there is insufficient social mobility in American society and has said it is the job of the government to raise the aspirations of people from poor backgrounds. 
									“I want to see a America that no matter where you come from, what god you worship, the colour of your skin, what community you belong to, you can get to the top in television, the judiciary, armed services, politics, newspapers,” the President Obama said in 2013. 
								
								<p>And a new study further backs the benefits of upward mobility and the positive consequences it may have on an individuals health. Prof Miller said the ability to conquer adversity was a ‘cure-all ailment’ which aided an individuals physical health at the same time as bringing success. 
									The researchers focused on a group of approximately 300 African-American teenagers making the transition from adolescence to adulthood. They tested them at the age of 17 and then again at 22. 
										The study found that those adolescents who have high levels of self-control, or the ability to focus on long-term goals over more immediate ones, fare better on a variety of psychological outcomes as young adults. </p>
								
								<p><b><h3>"They are less depressed, use substances less frequently and are less aggressive," added Professor Miller. 
									"That's true across the board, regardless of gender, family income and education." </h3></b></p>
								
								<p>When the researchers looked at how quickly their cells were ageing they found that the high-achievers were getting older slower. Older cells are related to more health problems, meaning these individuals have found a fountain of youth.
									"As disadvantaged youth strive for favorable life outcomes, they have substantial barriers to overcome and competing demands to balance, including resource-deprived schools, family obligations and managing social identity threats. These challenges are particularly salient for African-Americans," added Professor Miller. </p>
								
								<p>The researchers believe that overcoming social obstacles requires intense and persistent self-discipline which triggers the release of hormones and certain processes that help them slow down the physical demands of the body. 
									The research was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). </p>
