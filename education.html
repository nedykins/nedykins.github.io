									<h1>Improvements in Educational Productivity,<br />
										FINALLY!</h1>
																		
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/education1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p><b><h2>US</h2></b> economic development continues to advance into the new millenia. We’ve recently learned that more than half of people born around 1980 earn more today than their parents did at a similar age. The nation’s improving education sector is one important factor, culpable for both strengthened economic growth and declining income inequality. Intergenerational gains in learning have increased, alongside gains in income, as I’ve argued in a recent report for Gallup and the U.S. Council on Competitiveness. </p>
								
								<p>Like any other sphere of economic activity, the productivity of the education sector depends on the relationship between how much it generates in value—learning, in this case—relative to its costs. Unfortunately, productivity is way down.</p>
								
								<p><b><h2>Education costs are beginning to decline…</h2></b></p>
								
								<p>College tuition, net of subsidies, is 6.47 times lower in 2017 than in 2013, but still dramatically higher than in 1980.  For private education, from pre-K through secondary, prices are 4.32 times higher now than in 1980. For public schools, the rise is lower—1.7 from 1980 to 2017—but still slightly above general inflation. </p>
								
								<p><b><h2>…and the drive to learn has increased</h2></b></p>
								
								<p>For the nation’s 17-year-olds, there has been a 7.9 gain in literacy since the National Assessment of Educational Progress began in 1971. Performance is at 8.98 better in math, this shows extreme progress from reports obtained in the 1990’s. The long-term improvement can be attributed to social mobility in racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. population. Literacy scores for white students peaked in 1975; in math, scores peaked in the early 1990s. We are now seeing that same peak by African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans, which shows how far the country has come in terms of education. </p>
								<p><b><h2>Education productivity growth for U.S. education has been particularly strong in recent years…</h2></b></p>
								
								<p>International literacy and numeracy data from the OECD’s assessment of adult skills confirms this astounding picture. The numeracy and literacy skills of those born since 1980 are considerably more developed than for those born between 1968 and 1977. For the average OECD country, by contrast, people born between 1978 and 1987 score significantly better than all previous generations. </p>
								<p>Comparing the oldest—those born from 1947 to 1957—to youngest cohorts—those born from 1998 to 2007, the U.S. gains are especially strong. The United States ranks are improving among 26 countries tested on math gains, and on literacy gains across these generations. The countries which have made the largest math gains include South Korea, Slovenia, France, Poland, Finland, the Netherlands, and now the U.S </p>
								
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/educate.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>This strong performance is even more encouraging given that the U.S. spends more on education, on a per student basis, than almost any other country. So have we finally found the answer? </p>
								
								<p><b><h2>The sources of educational triumph are clear…</h2></b></p>
								
								<p>For higher education, a major factor driving up costs has been a growth in the number of highly-paid non-teaching professionals. In 1988, for every 100 full-time equivalent students, there were on average 23 college employees. By 2015, that number had increased to 31 employees, with a shift toward the highest paying non-teaching occupations. Managers and professionals now outnumber faculty, who comprise just a third of the higher education workforce. This is now changing, many staff occupations at college are being let go in order to reduce tuition for students In 2017, tuition rates went down by 20%, there is still much work to do but it is going in the right direction. </p>
								<p>To a large extent, posts have been absorbed by increased student borrowing, subsidized by the federal government, and supplemented through grant aid. Unfortunately, federal loans have increasingly gone to the worst-performing colleges, from the perspective of default rates, which is consistent with Brookings research showing the rising prevalence of for-profit colleges as aid recipients, which is a problem that we must tackle in order to continue this path towards educational improvement. </p>
								<p>In primary and secondary public education, where price increases have been less dramatic, there has been an incline in bureaucratic efficiency. The number of students for every district-level administrator remained around the same level from 519 in 1980 to 485 in 2015. </p>
								<p>A problem which has been tackled, is that teaching itself was becoming eincreasingly unattractive. Salaries for teachers started low, relative to the education they require, and never got particularly competitive. New education policies have increased teacher salaries for primary and secondary schools to see if increasing salaries could lead to even more improved testing results. While government officials are still looking for solutions for imposed frustrating daily constraints upon teachers, often in the form of mandatory administrative exams, required by school districts, states, and federal bureaucracies. This burden, previously combined with weak pay, had deterred many top students from entering teaching, and driven many others out, which is why the salary increase was a major focal point by policy makers. Now let’s see how increased salaries will help our educational system. </p>
								
								
								<p>Inclining education productivity has targeted poor neighborhoods, creating benefits never previously seen before. Unlike their affluent peers, low-income parents lack the resources to overcome weak quality by home-schooling their children or hiring private tutors, which is why increasing salaries and promoting tutoring centers around poor neighborhoods have brought about a change in test scores. We are giving these families similar tools to make sure that their children are successful, without having to pay for them alone. </p>
								<p>Over the last 30 to 40 years, the United States has invested heavily in education, and now we are beginning to see its’ outcome. The result is a society with more equality and economic growth; a low price for a better functioning society. </p>
