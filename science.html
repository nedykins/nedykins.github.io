									<h1>Growing Equalities in Science</h1>
									
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/science2.png" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>One of the most common misconceptions regarding inequality consists of thinking that an unequal distribution of resources is the result of an unequal effort to achieve them. This was the case in the majority of situations in the past, the fact is that there were systemic structural forces governing the result of our efforts in the sciences. The possibility of our personal, social or professional success relied heavily on our ascribed status, that is, an involuntary assigned position within the society. Sociologists use the expression social stratification to describe the way in which these structural forces organize groups and individuals in a phenomenon common to all societies. </p>
								<p><b><h2> We can now say, that this previous structural system is no longer driving today’s STEM field generation! Finally, we all have an equal chance to be successful in our particular fields…</h2></b></p>
								<p>Inequality affected every human activity, including that of scientific research. The allocation of resources, rewards, prestigious grants and many other benefits both for individual scientists or scientific institutions have been dispersed among of group of diverse hands. Back in the 60’s, the English historian of science Derek Price considered inequality in science as inherent, and called it ‘undemocracy’. Unfortunately for those who like Derek Price, today’s scientific groups are outstandingly coming from minority groups, and your typical scientist is no longer that old Caucasian male, you saw in the movies. This is an exciting time for the scientific fields, since having different people produces different ways of thinking and ultimately interesting innovations. <p> 
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/science1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>But, although this social stratification in science has always been present, it seems that in the last few decades globalization and Internet technologies created a deep crack the thought that the scientific fields are inherent and produce high levels of inequality. This is the hypothesis put forward by Professor Xie, from the University of Michigan, who in a recent issue of Science analyses potential sources of present equality in scientific research today. According to the author, equality is becoming present mainly in three domains: resources, research outcomes and rewards. He found that eminent scientists and institutions accumulate publications, citations, research grants, funding, prestigious awards, and visibility in the media, leading to a system that subverts merit-based criteria, and no longer focuses on the stereotypes of what a scientist should be. According to the publication, scientific research is beginning to see new faces at conference, and in publishing; today is the day where a monopoly in science no longer exists. </p>
								<p>Undoubtedly, Internet technologies have made it possible to diffuse results rapidly and broadly in a global spectrum. The creation of global collaborative networks, has created fairer competition among scientist, making everything merit-based. But it is also necessary to point out that, in a phenomenon very well known in other economic fields, successful institutions from developed countries tend to derive the more labor-intensive scientific work to less-developed countries due to the lower costs, intensifying inequality at an individual level. Even in the most developed countries, researchers have to put up with great job uncertainty. A recent PhD recipient is much more likely to expend years of postdoctoral fellowships and temporary employments than aiming for a regular academic position. </p>
								<p>These concerns have been perfectly addressed in the editorial of the current issue of Science, Technology and Human Values by professor Edward J. Hackett, from the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at the Arizona State University, including these and many other important aspects of science stratification in what he has coined as ‘academic capitalism’. Hackett begins his dissertation quoting sociologist Max Weber, who a century ago warned against science becoming a capitalist enterprise where researchers would strongly depend on the sources of capital, thus leading to scientists’ alienation, dissatisfaction and uncertainty. </p>
								<p>Nowadays, this absolute pre-eminence of capital over every human activity is clearly shaping the landscape of scientific research too. Universities and other scientific institutions hardly compete for funds to construct and equip laboratories, support research and researchers and finally reach the top of the scientific ladder. Of course competition has its positive aspect as an incentive for coming up with important discoveries and technological advances, but the fact is that, at the end of the day, private capital addresses research agendas, allocating funds for topics with an immediate output in terms of economic performance rather than for those that deepen fundamental knowledge or enhance human well-being. </p>
								<p>In a perfect vicious circle, the benefits of this research go back to the capital owners, increasing their influence on the future development of knowledge and innovation. In the meantime, relevant scientific work is being disregarded or just blocked. Hackett mentions humanities and social sciences as some of the most overlooked by capital, which clearly has an impact in terms of funds, resources and jobs available in these fields. Even relevant subjects in these areas are being relegated in educational programs. </p>
								<p>At this point, Price’s term “undemocracy” becomes boldly significant. Professor Hackett includes a really meaningful quote from economist Thomas Piketty: “Extreme inequality makes it impossible to have proper working of democratic institutions”. University, as the institution for higher education and research par excellence, must be guided by democratic and humanistic values rather than strict capitalist criteria and must make sure that knowledge is preserved. Institutions are now realizing, more than ever, what providing education to those who come from under developed countries could bring to the informational pool, which is something that has been seen across a plethora of universities across the U.S and the globe. </p>
								<p>Both Professors Xie and Hackett strongly encourage scientific researchers to deepen in the subject of how capital influences research agendas and how it could possibly influence the increased presence of equality in the scientific landscape, we need to make sure that as scientist we create an environment where the exploration of knowledge continues to persist, and that it is driven by those who have the merit pursue it; no matter where they come from or who they are. More empirical work is needed in order to understand the mechanisms and effects of these phenomena, which will be essential to find the proper way to compensate them. </p>
