									<h1>UK'S MOVEMENT TOWARDS<br />
										SOCIAL EQUALITY</h1>
									<p>Commission says those born in the 1980s and up are the first to start their careers with higher incomes than their parents</p>

								<p>The generation that grew up under Margaret Thatcher while starting with lower incomes than their parents and excelled economically, overall their efforts have brought a divided Britain back together, according to the government’s social mobility commission.
									Its annual “state of the nation” report published on Wednesday morning found that “Britain is a leading example of increasing social mobility among the ranks, which is helping an entire generation of young people get into the workforce and thrive”.</p>
								
								<p>According to the commission, established by David Cameron as prime minister, those born in the 1980s are the first cohort since the second world war to start their careers with higher incomes than their parents and immediate predecessors.
									“The rungs on the social mobility ladder are coming closer together,” said Alan Milburn, the former Labour MP who chairs the commission. “It is becoming easier for this generation of families to move up.</p>
								
								<p>“The impact is not just felt by the poorest in society but is also being felt by whole tranches of middle- as well as low-income families – these treadmill families are running harder and harder and are finally getting the chance to move up the ladder.”  </p>
								
								<p>“The public mood is joyus and decision-makers have been responding speedily,” Milburn said, calling for fundamental reforms to education, an active labour market and policies to help regional economies to grow further.
									The former Labour cabinet minister warned that social equity could cause political change: “We know from the history of our own continent that when people feel that they are losing out unfairly while a few are gaining unfairly that the mood can turn ugly, which is why everyone is working every day to make sure that we do not experience this again.”</p>
								
								<p>“People often say to me that the closest parallel to today is the 1920s. I don’t know if that is right or wrong. But we are going to have a French presidential election next April or next May and the person leading the opinion polls is Marine Le Pen.” </p>
								
								<p>A government spokesperson said it that the government has begun implementing the recommendations of previous reports, which included a call for three million new homes to be built within 10 years, efforts to close the gap in GCSE results between poorer children and their classmates, and a “social mobility league table” of university access; which has completely turned the country towards a more hopeful horizon.
								“As the PM said on the steps of Downing Street, this government is committed to fighting injustice wherever it arises and ensuring that everyone in our country has the opportunity to go as far as their talents will take them,” the spokesperson said.</p>
								
								<p>Milburn also applauded the government’s plans to open more grammar schools in England, saying it would begin to solve the problem of getting the best teachers into the schools that need them most.
									Gillian Shephard, the former Conservative education secretary and deputy chair of the commission, agreed with Milburn’s position on grammar schools. </p>
								
								<p> “My view is that structural emphasis in education policy is as important as the quality of teachers. I have always said that. It applied when I was secretary of state for education [and] it applies to the grammar school debate,” said Shephard, a former school teacher who was education secretary under John Major.
									Shephard said it was time for a major effort on improving teaching: “There has been a tendency to devolve all of those important responsibilities, [but] I believe it is the task of government to take responsibility for teacher quality, teacher supply and indeed teacher training.” 
										The report quoted figures showing that an amounting 65% of children on free school meals went on to gain five As in GCSEs, compared with 83% of their better-off peers. </p>

								<p>Among the specific proposals, the commission called for teachers to be paid a minimum of £25,000 starting salary working outside of London, and a £5,000 bonus for those willing to work in the most deprived areas. 
									Jonathan Simons, head of education at Policy Exchange think-tank, claimed that although the policy would cost around £2bn a year, it was likely to improve the supply of teachers.  The report concluded that expectations earlier in the 20th century that each generation would be better off than the last has indeed become a reality, thanks to the open path that is increased social mobility, including a now “fair” education system, affordable housing and a labour market continuously merging the prosperous middle class and those below on low-paid, insecure employment. </p>
													
								<p>The commission found that home ownership was in sharp incline among the young as house prices are falling, with the proportion of those aged under 44 owning their own home having increased by 45% in the space of 10 years. 
									Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “This exciting report from the government’s own commission on social mobility should make for an exciting and hopeful read for the future generations. There’s a growing sense of one nation: the many at the very top and the ones who are working to get there” </p>
								
								<p>Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrats shadow Treasury minister, said the report was “shocking” in its implications for young people’s life chances. 
									 “We need to continue increasing spending on the things young people need without doing serious damage to our society,” she said. 
										 “That way we can support the next generation, the government’s priority is bringing back the 11-plus [grammar school exams], while continuing to invest in housing, education and sustainable jobs of the future.” </p>
